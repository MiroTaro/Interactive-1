<strong>Every morning, <br></strong>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <small>from my small apartment<br></small>
<br>in downtown Toronto, <br>
I opened my computer <br>
and took care of the new blogs, <br>
helping them gain exposure and audience. <br>
<br>
It was a diverse crowd — <br>
from exiled authors and journalists, <br>
female diarists, <br>
and technology experts, <br>
to local journalists, <br>
politicians, clerics, and war veterans — <br>
and I always encouraged even more. <br>
<br>
I invited more religious,<br>
and pro-Islamic Republic men and women, <br>
people who lived inside Iran, <br>
to join and start writing.<br>
<br>
The breadth of what was available those days <br>
amazed us all. <br>
<br>
It was partly why I promoted blogging <br>
so seriously. <br>
<br>
I’d left Iran in late 2000 <br>
to experience living in the West, <br>
and was scared <br>
that I was missing <br>
all the rapidly emerging trends at home. <br>
<br>
But reading Iranian blogs in Toronto <br>
was the closest experience I could have <br>
to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran <br>
and listening to collective conversations <br>
between the talkative driver <br>
and random passengers.<br>
<br>
There’s a story in the Quran<br>
that I thought about a lot <br>
during my first eight months <br>
in solitary confinement. <br>
<br>
In it, <br>
a group of persecuted Christians <br>
find refuge in a cave. <br>
<br>
They, <br>
and a dog they have with them, <br>
fall into a deep sleep. <br>
<br>
They wake up under the impression <br>
that they’ve taken a nap: <br>
In fact, <br>
it’s 300 years later. <br>
<br>
One version of the story tells of <br>
how one of them goes out to buy food — <br>
and I can only imagine <br>
how hungry they must’ve been <br>
after 300 years — <br>
and discovers that <br>
his money is obsolete now, <br>
a museum item. <br>
<br>
That’s when he realizes <br>
how long they have actually been absent.<br>
<br>
The hyperlink <br>
was my currency six years ago. <br>
<br>
Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, <br>
the hyperlink provided <br>
a diversity and decentralisation<br>
 that the real world lacked. <br>
 <br>
 The hyperlink represented the open, <br>
 interconnected spirit <br>
 of the world wide web — <br>
 <br>
 a vision that started with its inventor, <br>
 Tim Berners-Lee. <br>
 <br>
 The hyperlink was a way <br>
 to abandon centralization — <br>
 all the links, lines and hierarchies — <br>
 and replace them with something <br>
 more distributed, <br>
 a system of nodes and networks.<br>
 <br>
Blogs gave form to that <br>
spirit of decentralization: <br>
They were windows into lives <br>
you’d rarely know much about; <br>
bridges that connected different lives <br>
to each other and thereby changed them. <br>
<br>
Blogs were cafes where people exchanged diverse ideas <br>
on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in.<br>
<br>
 They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.<br>
 <br>
Since I got out of jail, <br>
though, <br>
I’ve realized <br>
how much the hyperlink <br>
has been devalued, <br>
almost made obsolete.<br>
<br>
Nearly every social network now treats a link <br>
as just the same as it treats any other object — <br>
the same as a photo, <br>
or a piece of text — <br>
instead of seeing it <br>
as a way to make that text richer.<br>
<br>
 You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink <br>
 and expose it <br>
 to a quasi-democratic process of liking <br>
 and plussing and hearting: <br>
 Adding several links <br>
 to a piece of text <br>
 is usually not allowed. <br>
 <br>
 Hyperlinks are objectivized, <br>
 isolated, <br>
 stripped <br>
 of their powers.<br>

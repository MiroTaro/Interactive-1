  <h1>Every<br> morning,<br></h1>
  <h4>from my small apartment in downtown <strong>Toronto,</strong> I opened my computer and took care of the new <strong>blogs,</strong>
    helping them gain exposure and audience.</h4>
  <p>It was a <strong>diverse crowd</strong> <sub>— from exiled authors and journalists,
      female diarists, and technology experts, to local journalists, politicians, clerics, and war veterans —</sub> and
    I always encouraged even more. I invited more religious, and <strong>pro-Islamic</strong> Republic men and women,
    people who lived inside <strong>Iran,</strong> to join and start writing. The breadth of what was available those days
    amazed us all. It was partly</p>
  <h6><em>why I promoted blogging so seriously.</em></h6><br>
  <h1>I'd left Iran in late 2000 to experience</h1>
  <h3>living in the West, and was scared that I was missing all the<br>
    rapidly emerging trends at home. But reading Iranian blogs</h3>
  <h5>in Toronto was the <em>closest experience I could have to sitting in a shared taxi in Tehran and listening to collective conversations between the talkative driver and random passengers.</em></h5>
  <p>
    There’s a story in the <strong>Quran</strong> that I thought about a lot during my first eight months in solitary confinement. In it, <em>a group of persecuted Christians find refuge in a cave. They, and a dog they have with them, fall into a
      deep sleep. They wake up under the impression that they’ve taken a nap: In fact, it’s <strong>300 years later.</strong></em> One version of the story tells of how one of them goes out to buy food <sub>— and I can only imagine how hungry they
      must’ve been after 300 years — </sub>and discovers that his money is obsolete now, a museum item.That’s when he realizes how long they have actually been absent.
    The hyperlink was my currency six years ago. Stemming from the idea of the hypertext, the hyperlink provided a diversity and decentralisation that the real world lacked. The hyperlink represented the open, interconnected spirit of the world wide
    web <sup>— a vision that started with its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee.</sup> The <strong>hyperlink</strong> was a way to <em>abandon centralization </em><sub>— all the links, lines and hierarchies — </sub>and <em>replace them with something more
      distributed,</em> a system of nodes and networks.
    Blogs gave form to that spirit of <strong>decentralization:</strong> They were windows into lives you’d rarely know much about; bridges that connected different lives to each other and thereby changed them. <em>Blogs were cafes where people
      exchanged diverse ideas on any and every topic you could possibly be interested in.</em> They were Tehran’s taxicabs writ large.
    Since I got out of jail, though, I’ve realized <u>how much the hyperlink has been devalued,</u> almost made obsolete.
    Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object <sub>— the same as a photo, or a piece of text — </sub>instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You’re encouraged to post one single
    hyperlink and expose it to a <strong>quasi-democratic</strong> process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed.</p>
  <h3>Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.</h3>
